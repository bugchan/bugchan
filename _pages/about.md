Hello, I'm a PhD graduate student in Astronomy. I work in the Millimeter Lab with Gopal Narayanan. We are currently developing an 8-pixel focal plane receiver for the 1mm band with dual polarization and dual sideband called OMAyA. In addition, we are also working on a Dual Frequency Receiver for the next-generation of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) which will allow simultaneous observations at 230 and 345 GHz. Both receivers are to be commissioned on the Large Millimeter Telescope in Sierra Negra in Mexico. I'm also an EHT collaborator and work in the instrumentation and algorithms work groups. As a side project, I'm working on studying the magnetic field in MDwarfs through their lightcurves.
